## About
**Go-Reloaded** automates the cleanup and formatting of text files by applying a variety of modifications based on inline tags. This helps ensure that your documents follow consistent styling rules and improves their overall readability.

### What it does

**go-reloaded** performs several types of text modifications:

#### 1. Punctuation Formatting
- **Purpose:**  
  Adjusts spacing around punctuation marks (such as `.`, `,`, `!`, `?`, `:`, and `;`) so that they are attached directly to the previous word and followed by exactly one space.
- **Example:**  
  - Input:  
    ```
    I was sitting over there ,and then BAMM !!
    ```
  - Output:  
    ```
    I was sitting over there, and then BAMM!!
    ```

#### 2. Quote Formatting
- **Purpose:**  
  Ensures that single quotes are positioned directly next to the text they enclose by removing any extra spaces. Whether the quotes wrap a single word or multiple words, the tool "hugs" the content without additional spacing.
- **Example:**  
  - Input:  
    ```
    I am exactly how they describe me: ' awesome '
    ```
  - Output:  
    ```
    I am exactly how they describe me: 'awesome'
    ```

#### 3. Text Case Modification

- **Purpose:**  
  Recognizes inline tags such as `(up)`, `(low)`, and `(cap)` to modify the case of the preceding word. It also supports numbered variants—for example, `(up, 3)` will convert the last three words before the tag to uppercase.

- **Simple Example:**  
  - **Input:**  
    ```
    hello (up)
    ```  
  - **Output:**  
    ```
    HELLO
    ```

- **Numbered Variant Example:**  
  - **Input:**  
    ```
    one two three four five (up, 3)
    ```  
  - **Output:**  
    ```
    one two THREE FOUR FIVE
    ```
  - **Explanation:**  
    In this example, the tag `(up, 3)` tells the program to convert the three words immediately preceding it to uppercase. Thus, "three", "four", and "five" become "THREE", "FOUR", and "FIVE", while "one" and "two" remain unchanged.

#### 4. Numeric Conversion

**Binary Conversion (`(bin)` tag):**  
- **Purpose:**  
  Converts a binary number (base 2) to its decimal (base 10) equivalent. When the `(bin)` tag immediately follows a binary string, the tool parses the preceding word as a binary number and replaces it with the corresponding decimal value.  
- **Example:**  
  - **Input:**  
    ```
    1010 (bin)
    ```  
  - **Output:**  
    ```
    10
    ```  
  *Explanation:* The binary number `1010` is converted to the decimal number `10`.

**Hexadecimal Conversion (`(hex)` tag):**  
- **Purpose:**  
  Converts a hexadecimal number (base 16) to its decimal (base 10) equivalent. When the `(hex)` tag immediately follows a hexadecimal string, the tool parses the preceding word as a hexadecimal number and replaces it with its decimal value.  
- **Example:**  
  - **Input:**  
    ```
    1A (hex)
    ```  
  - **Output:**  
    ```
    26
    ```  
  *Explanation:* The hexadecimal number `1A` is converted to the decimal number `26`.

#### 5. Article Correction (`ConvertAtoAn`)
- **Purpose:**  
  Automatically converts instances of the article "a" to "an" when the following word begins with a vowel sound.
- **How It Works:**  
  The function scans the text for occurrences of "a" (or "A") and checks if the next word starts with one of the vowels (`a`, `e`, `i`, `o`, `u` in either case). If so, it appends an "n" to change "a" to "an".
- **Example:**  
  - Input:  
    ```
    a apple
    ```
  - Output:  
    ```
    an apple
    ```

## Installation

Steps to install and run **go-reloaded**:

1. **Clone the Repository:**
This command clones the repository to your local machine and navigates into the project directory
    ```bash
    git clone 
    cd go-reloaded
    ```

2. **Build the project:** Build the executable by running:
    ```bash
    go build ./cmd
    ```
3. **Run the Project:** You can run the project directly without building a seperate executable:
    ```bash
    go run ./cmd <input_filename.txt> <output_filename.txt>
    ```
    - **Note**:
    By default, input files should be placed in the text-files folder, and output files will be created in the outputs folder.

4. **Dependencies** This project requires Go 1.16 or later. All dependencies are managed through Go Modules, so no additional package installations are required.

## Usage
**Go-Reloaded** is designed to be run from the command line with two arguments: the input filename and the output filename. The program automatically assumes that:
- Input files are located in the `text-files` directory.
- Processed output files will be written to the `outputs` directory.

### Running the program
To run the program, use the following command:
```go
    go run ./cmd <input_filename> <output_filename>
```
